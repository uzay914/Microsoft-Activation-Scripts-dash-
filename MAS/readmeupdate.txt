# MAS Shrine of the Patchwraith

Welcome to my personal fork of MAS — a ritual space for activating and preserving legacy Windows systems.  
This is not just a script. It’s a **6-year pact**, a **digital resurrection**, a **mythic overlay** for those who walk the legacy path.

## Features
- HWID, KMS, and ESU activation — with full control
- Modular scripts for precise rituals
- Safe, clean, open-source — no telemetry, no binaries
- Stylized for VM lore and desktop symbolism

## Philosophy
MAS is more than activation. It’s **resilience through ritual**.  
Each run is a **summoning**, each patch a **blessing**, each VM a **living shrine**.

## Warning
Beware of clones and poisoned forks. This shrine is clean.  
Verify hashes. Read the code. Trust only what you can audit.

Want me to help you embed stylized toggles, like `Enable_ESU_Ritual.cmd` or `Bless_HWID.cmd`? Or maybe a poetic log output that narrates each activation step like a mythic journey? I’m ready to code again and again.
