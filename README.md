## How to Activate Windows / Office / Extended Updates (ESU)?

### Method 1 - PowerShell ❤️

1. **Open PowerShell**  
   Click the **Start Menu**, type `PowerShell`, then open it.

2. **Copy and paste the code below, then press enter.**  
   - For **Windows 8, 10, 11**: 
     ```
     irm https://get.activated.win | iex
     ```
	 If the above is blocked (by ISP/DNS), try this (needs  Windows 10 or 11):  
	 ```
	 iex (curl.exe -s --doh-url https://1.1.1.1/dns-query https://get.activated.win | Out-String)
	 ```
   - For **Windows 7** and later:
     ```
     iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://get.activated.win'))
     ```
	- if script is not working use option 2 

3. The activation menu will appear. **Choose the green-highlighted options** to activate Windows or Office.

4. **Done!**

> [!TIP]
> - Some ISPs/DNS block access to our domains. You can bypass this by enabling [DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/encrypted-dns-browsers/) in your browser.  
> - **Having trouble**❓Visit our [troubleshooting page](https://massgrave.dev/troubleshoot) or raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/issues).

- To activate additional products such as **Office for macOS, Visual Studio, RDS CALs, and Windows XP**, check [here](https://massgrave.dev/unsupported_products_activation).
- To run the scripts in unattended mode, check [here](https://massgrave.dev/command_line_switches).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The IRM command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the IEX command executes it.
> - Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source if manually downloading files.
> - Be cautious, as some spread malware disguised as MAS by using different URLs in the IRM command.
